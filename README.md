Using the D3 techniques, created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty`. The scatter plot represents each state with circle elements and situate axes labels are added to the left and bottom of the chart.

Note: You'll need to use python -m http-server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
